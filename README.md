The Banking System in Java is a console-based application designed to facilitate essential banking operations. It allows users to create bank accounts, manage their details, and perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application emphasizes secure data handling, user validation, and easy extensibility for future enhancements.

Features
User Registration:

Users can create an account by entering personal details such as first name, last name, CNIC, email, password, contact number, and address.
The system validates user inputs to ensure data integrity and proper formatting (e.g., CNIC format, email format, password strength).
Account Management:

Users can choose between different types of bank accounts, such as Current Accounts and Saving Accounts.
Each account type supports basic functionalities, such as checking balances, making deposits, and performing withdrawals.
Account Deletion:

Users can delete their accounts by providing their email, password, and CNIC.
The system verifies the provided details before removing the account, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform this action.
Input Validation:

The application includes robust input validation methods to handle various data types (e.g., integers, doubles) and formats (e.g., email, CNIC, contact numbers).
It prompts users to re-enter values in case of invalid inputs, enhancing the overall user experience.
User-Friendly Interface:

The console-based interface guides users through various operations with clear prompts and feedback messages.
